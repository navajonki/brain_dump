Here are the facts I could extract:

- The Zettelkasten Method is a personal knowledge management system developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann
- Luhmann published more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles
- He credited his productivity to his "slip-box" or Zettelkasten system
- The core principle is to create atomic notes, each containing a single idea
- These notes are linked together to form a network of knowledge
- This approach differs from traditional hierarchical note-taking
- Luhmann's system was analog, using paper cards in wooden boxes
- Each card had a unique identifier and cross-references to other cards
- Modern implementations use software like Obsidian, Roam Research, and Notion
