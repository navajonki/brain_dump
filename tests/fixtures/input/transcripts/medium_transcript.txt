The Zettelkasten Method is a personal knowledge management system developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann was incredibly prolific, publishing more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles on a variety of subjects. He credited his productivity to his "slip-box" or Zettelkasten system.

The core principle of the Zettelkasten method is to create atomic notes - each containing a single idea - and then link these notes together to form a network of knowledge. This approach differs from traditional note-taking methods that organize information hierarchically or chronologically.

Luhmann's system was analog, using paper cards stored in wooden boxes. Each card was given a unique identifier and contained cross-references to other cards. This created a web of interconnected ideas that could be traversed in multiple ways.

Modern digital implementations of the Zettelkasten method use software to create and link notes. Popular tools include Obsidian, Roam Research, and Notion, though any software that allows for linking between notes can be used.
