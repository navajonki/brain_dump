Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing. These models are trained using a technique called transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.

The training process for LLMs involves two main phases: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model learns from a vast corpus of text to predict the next token in a sequence. This unsupervised learning enables the model to capture patterns, grammar, and factual knowledge. The fine-tuning phase involves training the model on more specific tasks, often using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

LLMs face several technical challenges including hallucinations (generating false information), bias reproduction, and alignment with human values. Techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been developed to address some of these limitations.

The computational requirements for training state-of-the-art LLMs are substantial. GPT-4 reportedly required thousands of GPUs and cost tens of millions of dollars to train. This has led to concerns about the environmental impact and accessibility of LLM development.
