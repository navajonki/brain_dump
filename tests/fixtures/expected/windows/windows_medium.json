Luhmann was incredibly prolific, publishing more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles on a variety of subjects. He credited his productivity to his \"slip-box\" or Zettelkasten system.\n\nThe core principle of the Zettelkasten method is to create atomic notes - each containing a single idea - and then link these notes together to form a network of knowledge. This approach differs from traditional note-taking methods that organize information hierarchically or chronologically.",

Each card was given a unique identifier and contained cross-references to other cards. This created a web of interconnected ideas that could be traversed in multiple ways.",
